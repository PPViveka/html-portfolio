  Hi there! I'm Viveka, a budding web developer on a mission to master the art of coding and design. With a thirst for knowledge and a knack for problem-solving, I'm diving headfirst into the dynamic world of web development.
  Currently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm eager to create intuitive and visually appealing websites that leave a lasting impression.
